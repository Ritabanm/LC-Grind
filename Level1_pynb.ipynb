For example, with the input list `words = [\"pay\", \"attention\", \"practice\", \"attend\"]` and the prefix `pref = \"at\"`, the output should be `2` because the strings \"attention\" and \"attend\" start with \"at\".\n",

This involves creating a substring of the word up to the length of `pref` (i.e., `w[:N]`) and then comparing this substring to `pref`. The creation of the substring is \\( O(p) \\), where \\( p \\) is the length of the prefix, and the comparison also takes \\( O(p) \\) time. Thus, each comparison effectively is \\( O(p) \\).\n",

        "\n",
        "### Space Complexity:\n",
        "1. **Variables:** The space used for variables `N` and `res` is constant, \\( O(1) \\).\n",
        "2. **Substring Creation:** In each iteration of the loop, a new substring of length up to \\( p \\) is created. However, this substring is temporary and does not accumulate, as it is only used for the duration of the comparison.\n",
        "\n",
        "The significant factor here is the temporary space used for the substring in each loop iteration. Despite this, the space complexity remains \\( O(1) \\) because this space is reused for each word, and no additional space proportional to the input size is used permanently throughout the function's execution.\n",
