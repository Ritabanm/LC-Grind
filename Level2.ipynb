        "\n",
        "Here's an explanation of how it works:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Overview**\n",
        "\n",
        "The algorithm consists of two main parts: DFS (Depth-First Search) and BFS (Breadth-First Search). The DFS part is used to mark all reachable cells from the starting island, while the BFS part is used to find the shortest bridge between two islands.\n",
        "\n",
        "**DFS**\n",
        "\n",
        "The `dfs` function takes a row `r` and column `c` as input and performs a depth-first search on the grid starting from that cell. The DFS function checks if the current cell is valid (i.e., within the grid boundaries), not visited before, and contains a 1 (which represents an island). If any of these conditions are not met, it returns immediately.\n",
        "\n",
        "If all conditions are met, it marks the current cell as visited by adding its coordinates to the `visit` set. Then, it recursively calls itself for each of its four neighboring cells (up, down, left, and right) to explore the adjacent islands.\n",
        "\n",
        "**BFS**\n",
        "\n",
        "The `bfs` function is used to find the shortest bridge between two islands. It maintains a queue of visited cells and iterates through them level by level. For each cell, it checks all four possible directions (up, down, left, and right). If a valid cell with value 0 (which represents an empty cell) is found, it returns the current distance `res` as the length of the shortest bridge.\n",
        "\n",
        "If no valid cell is found in any direction, it increments the distance `res` by 1 and adds all new unvisited cells to the queue. This process continues until either a bridge is found or all reachable cells from the starting island are visited.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Main Loop**\n",
        "\n",
        "The main loop iterates over each cell in the grid. If a cell contains an island (i.e., its value is 1), it calls the `dfs` function to mark all reachable cells from that island and then calls the `bfs` function to find the shortest bridge. The result is returned immediately.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Time Complexity**\n",
        "\n",
        "The time complexity of this algorithm can be broken down into two parts:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   DFS: In the worst case, the DFS function visits all unvisited cells in the grid once. This takes O(N \\* M) time, where N and M are the dimensions of the grid.\n",
        "*   BFS: The BFS function performs a level-order traversal of the visited cells. Since each cell has at most 4 neighbors (up, down, left, right), the maximum number of cells in the queue is bounded by O(N \\* M). In each iteration, it visits at most N \\* M cells.\n",
        "\n",
        "Therefore, the overall time complexity of this algorithm is O(N \\* M) + O(N \\* M) = O(2N\\*M), which simplifies to O(N \\* M).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Space Complexity**\n",
        "\n",
        "The space complexity can be broken down into two parts:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   DFS: The `visit` set stores at most N \\* M cells, so its space complexity is O(N \\* M).\n",
        "*   BFS: The queue of visited cells has a maximum size of O(N \\* M), and each cell requires O(1) extra memory.\n",
        "\n",

        "Update Res and Bounds : If it is possible to ship with the current capacity (canShip(cap) == True), it updates the result value to be the minimum of the current capacity and the previous best capacity found (res = min(res, cap)). It also adjusts the upper bound for the next iteration by setting r = cap - 1.\n",
