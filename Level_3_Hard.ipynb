        "The Python code implements a method to determine if a string `s` can be transformed into a palindrome by removing at most `k` characters. It uses recursion with memoization to efficiently solve the problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Components of the Solution:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **`isValidPalindrome` Function**: This is the primary function that initializes memoization and calls the recursive helper function.\n",
        "   \n",
        "2. **`is_palindrome` Helper Function**: This function checks if a substring of `s`, defined by indices `i` and `j`, is a palindrome. It iterates from both ends towards the center, comparing characters.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **`helper` Recursive Function**: This function uses memoization to store results for specific subproblems `(i, j, k)` where `i` and `j` are the start and end indices of the substring, and `k` is the remaining number of removals allowed.\n",
        "   - If the result for `(i, j, k)` is already computed, it returns it from `memo`.\n",
        "   - If `k` is zero, it checks if the substring `s[i:j+1]` is a palindrome.\n",
        "   - If the characters at positions `i` and `j` are the same, it simply moves inward.\n",
        "   - If the characters differ, it recursively checks two possibilities:\n",
        "     - Remove the character at `i` and see if the resulting substring can form a palindrome with `k-1` removals.\n",
        "     - Remove the character at `j` and check similarly.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Memoization**: The `memo` dictionary is used to cache results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations and thus reduce time complexity.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Time Complexity:\n",
        "The time complexity is O(n^2 * k) where `n` is the length of the string. This is because, for each pair `(i, j)`, we potentially compute results for each value of `k` from 1 up to `k`, and each computation involves constant time operations due to memoization.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Space Complexity:\n",
        "The space complexity is O(n^2 * k) due to the memoization dictionary that could potentially store an entry for each combination of `i`, `j`, and `k`. The recursive call stack will also use space, but this will be considerably less than the space used by the memoization dictionary in the worst case.\n",
        "\n",
        "This method is efficient for inputs where `n` and `k` are moderately sized, allowing the transformation check to be feasible within the problem constraints."
