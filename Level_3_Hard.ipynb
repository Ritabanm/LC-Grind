        "The Python code implements a method to determine if a string `s` can be transformed into a palindrome by removing at most `k` characters. It uses recursion with memoization to efficiently solve the problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Components of the Solution:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **`isValidPalindrome` Function**: This is the primary function that initializes memoization and calls the recursive helper function.\n",
        "   \n",
        "2. **`is_palindrome` Helper Function**: This function checks if a substring of `s`, defined by indices `i` and `j`, is a palindrome. It iterates from both ends towards the center, comparing characters.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **`helper` Recursive Function**: This function uses memoization to store results for specific subproblems `(i, j, k)` where `i` and `j` are the start and end indices of the substring, and `k` is the remaining number of removals allowed.\n",
        "   - If the result for `(i, j, k)` is already computed, it returns it from `memo`.\n",
        "   - If `k` is zero, it checks if the substring `s[i:j+1]` is a palindrome.\n",
        "   - If the characters at positions `i` and `j` are the same, it simply moves inward.\n",
        "   - If the characters differ, it recursively checks two possibilities:\n",
        "     - Remove the character at `i` and see if the resulting substring can form a palindrome with `k-1` removals.\n",
        "     - Remove the character at `j` and check similarly.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Memoization**: The `memo` dictionary is used to cache results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations and thus reduce time complexity.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Time Complexity:\n",
        "The time complexity is O(n^2 * k) where `n` is the length of the string. This is because, for each pair `(i, j)`, we potentially compute results for each value of `k` from 1 up to `k`, and each computation involves constant time operations due to memoization.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Space Complexity:\n",
        "The space complexity is O(n^2 * k) due to the memoization dictionary that could potentially store an entry for each combination of `i`, `j`, and `k`. The recursive call stack will also use space, but this will be considerably less than the space used by the memoization dictionary in the worst case.\n",
        "\n",
        "This method is efficient for inputs where `n` and `k` are moderately sized, allowing the transformation check to be feasible within the problem constraints."

        "The provided Python function solves the \"Word Ladder\" problem using a breadth-first search (BFS) approach. Let's break down how the function works and then discuss its time and space complexity:\n",
        "\n",
        "### Function Breakdown\n",
        "1. **Initial Checks**:\n",
        "   - It first checks if `endWord` is in `wordList`. If not, it returns 0 because no transformation sequence can be completed.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Building Neighbors**:\n",
        "   - A dictionary (`nei`) is built to keep track of all possible words from `wordList` that can be formed by changing one letter at a time. This is done by replacing each character of the word with a wildcard character \"*\". For example, \"log\" would produce \"*og\", \"l*g\", and \"lo*\".\n",
        "   - This helps in quickly finding all adjacent words (neighbors) during the BFS.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:\n",
        "   - A queue initialized with `beginWord` is used to explore each word level by level.\n",
        "   - For each word, it's checked if it's the `endWord`. If so, the current depth (or distance) `res` is returned.\n",
        "   - Otherwise, for each pattern of the current word, it checks all neighboring words (connected in the `nei` dictionary). If a neighbor hasn't been visited, it's added to the queue.\n",
        "   - After exploring all words at the current depth, `res` is incremented.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Return**:\n",
        "   - If the BFS completes without finding the `endWord`, the function returns 0, indicating no valid transformation sequence exists.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Time Complexity\n",
        "- **Building Neighbors**: \\(O(N \\times M^2)\\), where \\(N\\) is the number of words in `wordList` (including `beginWord` appended to it) and \\(M\\) is the length of each word. This accounts for the \\(M\\) patterns per word and checking every character in the word.\n",
        "- **BFS Execution**: Each word can enter the queue once, and for each word, checking all \\(M\\) patterns and the possible words for those patterns (at most \\(N\\) in the worst case if all patterns match all words) leads to \\(O(N \\times M \\times W)\\), where \\(W\\) is the average number of words per pattern.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Space Complexity\n",
        "- **Neighbor Dictionary (`nei`)**: Could hold at most \\(M \\times N\\) entries, with each entry containing a list of words that match the pattern, potentially storing \\(N\\) words in each list. Thus, the space complexity can also be significant: \\(O(N \\times M \\times N)\\) in the worst-case scenario due to all words matching all patterns.\n",
        "- **BFS Structures**: The queue and the visited set can hold at most \\(N\\) elements, leading to \\(O(N)\\).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Summary\n",
        "The approach is effective for smaller word lists but might become inefficient both in time and space with large word lists or long words due to the quadratic dependency on the number of words and the length of words. This algorithm ensures that we find the shortest transformation sequence efficiently using BFS, which explores all possible transformations level by level."

        "   - For each node, we calculate two things:\n",

        "This code is a solution to the \"Clean Room\" problem, where we need to clean all cells in a room using a robot that can move in four directions (up, down, left, right).\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's a breakdown of how it works:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Functions:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. `go_back()`: This function makes the robot turn around and move one step back.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. `backtrack(cell=(0, 0), d=0)`: This is the main recursive function that cleans the room. It takes two parameters:\n",
        "   - `cell`: The current cell being cleaned (default value is `(0, 0)`).\n",
        "   - `d`: The direction of the robot (default value is `0`, which corresponds to 'up' and is used as a reference for other directions).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Backtracking Algorithm:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. The function adds the current cell to the `visited` set to keep track of cells that have been cleaned.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. It cleans the current cell by calling `robot.clean()`.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. For each possible direction (clockwise order: up, right, down, left), it checks if:\n",
        "   - The new cell has not been visited (`new_cell not in visited`) and\n",
        "   - The robot can move to that cell without going out of bounds (`robot.move()` returns `True`).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. If the conditions are met, it recursively calls itself with the new cell coordinates and direction.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. After each recursive call, it calls `go_back()` to make the robot turn around and move one step back in the current direction (clockwise). This ensures that the robot always moves forward and does not backtrack.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. The function returns after cleaning all reachable cells from a given starting point.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Main Logic:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. The `backtrack` function is called with an initial cell `(0, 0)` and no direction (`d=0`, which corresponds to 'up').\n",
        "\n",
        "2. The robot moves in the specified directions (clockwise order) until it reaches a dead end or all cells have been cleaned.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. When all reachable cells from a starting point have been cleaned, the function returns, and the process starts again with a new starting cell.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Insights:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- This algorithm uses depth-first search to explore all possible paths in the room.\n",
        "- By using `go_back()` to turn around and move back after each recursive call, we ensure that the robot always moves forward and does not backtrack.\n",
        "- The use of `visited` set to keep track of cleaned cells prevents the robot from revisiting the same cell multiple times.\n",
