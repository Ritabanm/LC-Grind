        "The Python code implements a method to determine if a string `s` can be transformed into a palindrome by removing at most `k` characters. It uses recursion with memoization to efficiently solve the problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Components of the Solution:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **`isValidPalindrome` Function**: This is the primary function that initializes memoization and calls the recursive helper function.\n",
        "   \n",
        "2. **`is_palindrome` Helper Function**: This function checks if a substring of `s`, defined by indices `i` and `j`, is a palindrome. It iterates from both ends towards the center, comparing characters.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **`helper` Recursive Function**: This function uses memoization to store results for specific subproblems `(i, j, k)` where `i` and `j` are the start and end indices of the substring, and `k` is the remaining number of removals allowed.\n",
        "   - If the result for `(i, j, k)` is already computed, it returns it from `memo`.\n",
        "   - If `k` is zero, it checks if the substring `s[i:j+1]` is a palindrome.\n",
        "   - If the characters at positions `i` and `j` are the same, it simply moves inward.\n",
        "   - If the characters differ, it recursively checks two possibilities:\n",
        "     - Remove the character at `i` and see if the resulting substring can form a palindrome with `k-1` removals.\n",
        "     - Remove the character at `j` and check similarly.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Memoization**: The `memo` dictionary is used to cache results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations and thus reduce time complexity.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Time Complexity:\n",
        "The time complexity is O(n^2 * k) where `n` is the length of the string. This is because, for each pair `(i, j)`, we potentially compute results for each value of `k` from 1 up to `k`, and each computation involves constant time operations due to memoization.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Space Complexity:\n",
        "The space complexity is O(n^2 * k) due to the memoization dictionary that could potentially store an entry for each combination of `i`, `j`, and `k`. The recursive call stack will also use space, but this will be considerably less than the space used by the memoization dictionary in the worst case.\n",
        "\n",
        "This method is efficient for inputs where `n` and `k` are moderately sized, allowing the transformation check to be feasible within the problem constraints."

        "The provided Python function solves the \"Word Ladder\" problem using a breadth-first search (BFS) approach. Let's break down how the function works and then discuss its time and space complexity:\n",
        "\n",
        "### Function Breakdown\n",
        "1. **Initial Checks**:\n",
        "   - It first checks if `endWord` is in `wordList`. If not, it returns 0 because no transformation sequence can be completed.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Building Neighbors**:\n",
        "   - A dictionary (`nei`) is built to keep track of all possible words from `wordList` that can be formed by changing one letter at a time. This is done by replacing each character of the word with a wildcard character \"*\". For example, \"log\" would produce \"*og\", \"l*g\", and \"lo*\".\n",
        "   - This helps in quickly finding all adjacent words (neighbors) during the BFS.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:\n",
        "   - A queue initialized with `beginWord` is used to explore each word level by level.\n",
        "   - For each word, it's checked if it's the `endWord`. If so, the current depth (or distance) `res` is returned.\n",
        "   - Otherwise, for each pattern of the current word, it checks all neighboring words (connected in the `nei` dictionary). If a neighbor hasn't been visited, it's added to the queue.\n",
        "   - After exploring all words at the current depth, `res` is incremented.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Return**:\n",
        "   - If the BFS completes without finding the `endWord`, the function returns 0, indicating no valid transformation sequence exists.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Time Complexity\n",
        "- **Building Neighbors**: \\(O(N \\times M^2)\\), where \\(N\\) is the number of words in `wordList` (including `beginWord` appended to it) and \\(M\\) is the length of each word. This accounts for the \\(M\\) patterns per word and checking every character in the word.\n",
        "- **BFS Execution**: Each word can enter the queue once, and for each word, checking all \\(M\\) patterns and the possible words for those patterns (at most \\(N\\) in the worst case if all patterns match all words) leads to \\(O(N \\times M \\times W)\\), where \\(W\\) is the average number of words per pattern.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Space Complexity\n",
        "- **Neighbor Dictionary (`nei`)**: Could hold at most \\(M \\times N\\) entries, with each entry containing a list of words that match the pattern, potentially storing \\(N\\) words in each list. Thus, the space complexity can also be significant: \\(O(N \\times M \\times N)\\) in the worst-case scenario due to all words matching all patterns.\n",
        "- **BFS Structures**: The queue and the visited set can hold at most \\(N\\) elements, leading to \\(O(N)\\).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Summary\n",
        "The approach is effective for smaller word lists but might become inefficient both in time and space with large word lists or long words due to the quadratic dependency on the number of words and the length of words. This algorithm ensures that we find the shortest transformation sequence efficiently using BFS, which explores all possible transformations level by level."

        "\n",
        "2. **BFS Traversal**: BFS is conducted starting from the `beginWord`, exploring all possible transformations. Each word visited is tracked to avoid revisiting and the sequence length is incremented at each level of BFS traversal.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Time Complexity\n",
        "- **O(N \\times M^2)**: Where \\( N \\) is the number of words in the `wordList` (including `beginWord`) and \\( M \\) is the length of each word. The complexity arises from constructing the graph where each word's transformation needs to be computed and stored.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Space Complexity\n",
        "- **O(N \\times M)**: Mainly due to the storage required for the graph and the queue. The graph might contain \\( M \\) different keys for each word's transformations, with each key pointing to potentially multiple words.\n",
